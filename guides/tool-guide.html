In this section we're gonna explain all the basics of Demon Tools: where to get them, how to strengthen them, all possible bonuses they can get and much more.<br>
<br>

<h1>What are Demon Tools?</h1><br>
Demon Tools or <i>Yougu (妖具)</i> are the equips from Maji Battle. There are three different types of tools: <u>weapons</u>, <u>armors</u> and <u>accessories</u>, which can be equipped in their own slots (there are 2 weapon slots, 2 armor slots and 1 accessory slot for every character, regardless of their type and rarity).<br>
<br>

<h1>Where to Get Them</h1><br>
You can farm for Demon Tools in the <i>Demon Tool Quest</i> stages. Each stage have specific characters that can show up when you play -- and each of these characters drops a specific weapon whenever you beat them. The chance of drop is 100% if you meet said character on the stage. Ex. if you play the Mashoutsukai Team Stage, you might face Jin, Gama, Touya, Bakken or Rishou in those waves. Jin drops his Wind Suit, Touya drops his Ice Sword, and so on. If a stage has different versions of a chara (like a Dex and a Yin Hiei on the Urameshi Team Stage), each Hiei drops a different item. Dex Hiei drops the Armor while Yin Hiei drops the Weapon.<br>
<br>
Every stage has 3 difficulties - easy, medium and hard; the higher the stage difficulty, the <u>more likely it is</u> for a special character to show up in a wave and drop a weapon (it's not 100% chance they'll show up, though, so you can face only 2 special characters on the hardest difficulty instead of 3). You'll always face a special character in the last wave, regardless of difficulty.<br>

<center><img></center><br>

There's 2 sets of Demon Tool Quests to farm that changes every day so if you wish to farm for a specific tool but its quest isn't available, it'll be there on the next day.<br>
<br>

<h1>Demon Tool Effects</h1><br>
Every Demon Tool will come up with a random attribute and a few <b>bonuses</b> that will have different effects on the equipping character. Those bonuses are <i>Attached Effect</i>, <i>Attribute Exclusive Effect</i>, <i>Set Effect</i> and <i>Character Specific Effects</i>, and their effect changes from tool to tool, as we'll explain below.<br>
<br>
<b>Attached Effect</b><br>
The Attached Effect is determined in the moment of the drop and can have different kinds of bonuses depending on the tool type. Those bonuses can have different ranks, which are also chosen at the moment of the drop and <u>cannot be improved</u>; so if you get a low rank effect, that weapon is going to have it forever. The lowest rank is 1 and gives 1% of the bonus, while the max rank 10 gives 10%.<br>
<br>
<i>Possible Weapon Effects</i><br>
• Basic Attack Damage Up (通常攻撃与ダメージ増加)<br>
• Special Damage Up (必殺技与ダメージ増加)<br>
• ATK Damage Up (攻撃力与ダメージ増加)<br>
• SP Damage Up (妖力与ダメージ増加)<br>
• Critical Up (会心率アップ)<br>
<br>
<i>Possible Armor Effects</i><br>
• Basic Attack Taken Damage Reduction (通常攻撃被ダメージ減少)<br>
• Special Taken Damage Reduction (必殺技被ダメージ減少)<br>
• ATK Taken Damage Reduction (攻撃力被ダメージ減少)<br>
• SP Taken Damage Reduction (妖力被ダメージ減少)<br>
• Guard Up (ガード率アップ)<br>
<br>
Accessories can have attached effects from <u>both types</u>.<br>
<br>
<b>Attribute Exclusive Effect</b><br>
Attribute Specific Effects can only be acquired when the tool reaches 5★ rarity and said bonus will only work when equipped by a character that has <b>the same attribute</b> as the tool (ex. a dex tool equipped in a dex unit). The kind of bonus you get is changeable through <i>forging</i>, and requires another 5★ tool in order to perform the change (that tool can be the 5★ Tempering Demon Stone bought at the exchange shop since it counts as an accessory). The bonus you acquire through this method will be random, unless the tool you use as the material shares the same attribute exclusive effect as the base tool. Also, every time you perform a new forge, the effect's rank will increase by one or two. After it reaches max rank (lv.10), only the effect will change.<br>
<br>
The Attribute Exclusive Effects also depend on the tool type and are as follows:<br>
<br>
<i>Possible Weapon Effects</i><br>
・ATK up [攻撃力アップ] (+15%)<br>
・SP up [妖力アップ] (+15%)<br>
・Critical Up [会心率アップ] (+10%)<br>
・Basic Attack Damage Up [通常攻撃与ダメージ増加] (+15%)<br>
・Special Damage Up [必殺技与ダメージ増加] (+15%)<br>
・ATK Damage Up [攻撃力与ダメージ増加] (+15%)<br>
・SP Damage Up [妖力与ダメージ増加] (+15%)<br>
<br>
<i>Possible Armor Effects</i><br>
・DEF up [防御力アップ] (+15%)<br>
・Guard Percentage Up [ガード率アップ] (+10%)<br>
・Basic Attack Taken Damage Reduction [通常攻撃被ダメージ減少] (+15%)<br>
・Special Taken Damage Reduction [必殺技被ダメージ減少] (+15%)<br>
・ATK Taken Damage Reduction [攻撃力被ダメージ減少] (+15%)<br>
・SP Taken Damage Reduction [妖力被ダメージ減少] (+15%)<br>
<br>
<i>Possible Accessory Effects</i><br>
・Paralyze Immunity (麻痺耐性)<br>
・Stun Immunity (気絶耐性)<br>
・Freeze Immunity (氷耐性)<br>
・Poison Immunity (毒耐性)<br>
・Burn Immunity (火傷耐性)<br>
・Blind Immunity (暗闇耐性)<br>
・Silence Immunity (沈黙耐性)<br>
<br>
<i>※ The above effects values are based on a lv. 10 rank tool.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Set Effect</b><br>
Set Effects are granted if you wear two or more tools from the same set (ex. equip the Demon Compass and the Mystic Whistle from the Spirit Detective 7 Tools Set on a single unit). The more tools from the same set you equip, the stronger the bonus will be. Keep this in mind when choosing the tools you put in your units.<br>
<br>
There are 12 sets in total and their effects are as follows:<br>
<br>
<i>・Spirit Detective 7 Tools Set:</i>  Given Damage increase (+8% with 5 tools) & SP up (fixed at 5% when equipped with 3 or more tools).<br>
<i>・Three Artifacts of Darkness Set:</i>  DEF up (+10% with 5 tools) & ATK up (fixed at 5% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Genkai's Disciple Selection Set:</i>  ATK up (+10% with 5 tools) & DEF up (fixed at 5% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Three Demon's Set:</i>  DEF up (+10% with 5 tools) & SP up (fixed at 5% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・B • B • C Set:</i>  Taken Damage decrease (+5% with 3 tools) & Given Damage increase (fixed at 4% when equipped with 3 tools).<br>
<i>・Saint Beasts Set:</i>  SP up (+10% with 5 tools) & Given Damage increase (fixed at 4% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Rokuyukai Team Set:</i>  Guard up (+8% with 5 tools) & Given Damage increase (fixed at 4% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Dr.Ichigaki Team Set:</i>  Critical up (+8% with 5 tools) & Guard up (fixed at 4% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Mashoutsukai Team Set:</i>  Critical up (+8% with 5 tools) & ATK up (fixed at 5% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Uraotogi Team Set:</i>  Critical Damage (+12% with 5 tools) & Critical up (fixed at 4% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Toguro Team Set:</i>  ATK up (+10% with 5 tools) & Taken Damage decrease (fixed at 4% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<i>・Urameshi Team Set:</i>  SP up (+10% with 5 tools) & Taken Damage decrease (fixed at 4% when equipped with 3+ tools).<br>
<br>
<b>Character Specific Effect</b><br>
Character Specific Effects are granted only when the tool is equipped by determinate character (ex. equipping the Trial Sword on a Kuwabara unit will grant ATK +5%). Not all tools have character specific effects, since they are more "generic" tools in the story. Equipping a tool on its specific character isn't mandatory, unless you really want the bonus. Prioritizing character-specific tools on your characters will probably give you less set bonuses, so choose carefully.<br>
<br>
<h1>Strengthening Your Tools</h1><br>
There are 4 processes of tool strengthening: raising their level with <i>strengthening</i>, increasing their rarity by <i>evolving</i>, changing their attribute specific effect with <i>forging</i> and increasing their rank with <i>awakening</i>.<br>
<br>
<b>Strengthening</b><br>
To increase a tool's level you need to use <u>Demon Steel Stones</u>, the blue stones you drop from Demon Tool Quests. The smallest stone gives 50 exp, the medium gives 300 exp, the big gives 1500 exp and the biggest gives 5000 (and it's unobtainable at the moment). After the tool reaches max level you can increase its rarity.<br>
<br>
<b>Evolving</b><br>
After your tool is on its max level, you can use a <b>same rarity material</b> to evolve it, which increases their rarity and max level. Acceptable materials for this process are other tools or the <u>Tempering Demon Stones</u>, which can drop from Demon Tool Quests on 1~2★ rarities or bought with Demon Tool Medals on 3~5★ rarities in the Exchange Shop.<br>
<br>
<b>Forging</b><br>
The forging process is only available after your tool reaches max rarity, 5★. As soon as you reach it, a random attribute specific effect will be granted to it on lv.1. To change the effect and further increase its level, you need to use a <u>same rarity material</u> to play the roulette, which will give you a random attribute depending on the tool type and will also increase the effect level by one or two. If you don't reforge your tool, its effect will stay at lv.1, so it's important to forge. If you wish to keep the effect of a tool and only increase its level, you'll have to use a material that has the same effect as the base tool.<br>
<br>
<b>Awakening</b><br>
Awakening works the same way as the other units awakenings: you use dupes to increase the tool's rank. Please note that the necessary dupes required to increase a tool's rank will change with its rarity! So a 3★ tool needs <i>more dupes</i> to increase its rank than a 2★, and so on. If you have previously increased a tool's rank before increasing its rarity, their rank <u>can drop</u> because of the process, but no dupes will be lost.<br>

<br>
Also, if you use a previously awakened tool in a material consuming process (evolving, forging, awakening or selling), you'll get 10 Demon Tool Medals per awakening value (ex. if you use a rank E tool in a evolving process, you'll get 20 medals).<br>
<br>
<h1>Tool Specific Items</h1><br>
You can acquire Demon Tool Specific Items in the <i>Demon Tool Medal Exchange Shop</i>. This shop features 3~5★Tempering Demon Stones and the tool slot opening items Twilight (1~4★) & Morning Star (5★) Demon Sand. In order to get Demon Tool Medals to use in this shop you need to sell Demon Tools. You get 10 medals for 1★ tools, 20 medals for 2★ tools, 50 medals for 3★ tools, 100 medals for 4★ tools and 200 medals for 5★ tools.<br>
